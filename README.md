This package provides some widgets to be used in Pluto, including an extended version of the TableOfContents from PlutoUI and a new experimental bond container (`BondTable`). 

See the [documentation](https://disberd.github.io/PlutoExtras.jl/) for more details.

This was formerly a non-registered package named PlutoUtils
## Note
To check out the functionalities in more detail, check the notebooks located in the test folder at [test/notebooks](./test/notebooks/) (You have to execute them from their original folder within the package folder, or the loading of the package with `@frompackage` will fail.)
